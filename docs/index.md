# Pyronsworn
Pyronsworn is a Python module made to assist players of the tabletop rpg Ironsworn. This website serves as the official homepage of the project. Documentation is available here, and also on the [project website](https://jhilker.gitlab.io/pyronsworn).

Similar to the ncurses and Tkinter modules, Pyronsworn is not in and of itself a program. Instead, it is used to make programs to assist with running or playing the game - for instance, a campaign manager or a campaign journal application.

I did not create Ironsworn, but as a player and fan of the game, I wanted to create a module that could help people integrate the game into their programs. Instead of donating to me for the program, go buy the game.
